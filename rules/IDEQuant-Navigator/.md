This rule guides you through analyzing stock data to identify stocks that hit the daily limit up, detect stocks with significant institutional inflow and upward trends, and, if needed, automate the process with quantitative scripts and Markdown reports. You’ll use the provided tools (`get-stock-data`, `get-daily-stock-data`, `get-stock-alerts`) and resources (`stock-data`, `hs-stock-data`, `us-stock-data`) to accomplish these tasks.

### Task 1: Finding Stocks that Hit the Daily Limit Up Based on the Day's Data

The "daily limit up" refers to stocks reaching the maximum allowed price increase in a trading day (e.g., 10% in the Chinese market). Here’s how to identify such stocks using the day’s stock data:

#### Steps for a Single Stock

1. **Fetch Previous Day’s Closing Price**:
   - Use `get-daily-stock-data` with the stock symbol and `outputsize='full'` to retrieve historical daily data.
   - Extract the closing price from the previous trading day.
2. **Calculate Limit Up Price**:
   - Multiply the previous day’s close by (1 + limit_percentage). For Chinese stocks, this is typically `1.10` (10%).
   - Example: If previous close = 100, limit up price = 100 \* 1.10 = 110.
3. **Check Day’s High Price**:
   - Use `get-stock-data` with the symbol and an interval (e.g., `interval='1min'`) to get intraday data for the current day.
   - Alternatively, if analyzing historical data, use `get-daily-stock-data` to get the day’s high price.
   - If the high price ≥ limit up price, the stock hit the limit up.

#### Example for a Chinese Stock

- **Stock**: `sh601009`
- **Previous Close**: Use `get-daily-stock-data('sh601009', outputsize='full')` to get yesterday’s close (e.g., 10.00).
- **Limit Up Price**: 10.00 \* 1.10 = 11.00.
- **Today’s High**: Use `get-stock-data('sh601009', interval='1min')` to find the day’s high (e.g., 11.05).
- **Result**: Since 11.05 ≥ 11.00, `sh601009` hit the limit up.

#### For Multiple Stocks

- Manually repeat the process for each stock in your list.
- Alternatively, use resources like `hs-stock-data` (e.g., `hs-stock://sh601009`) for Chinese stocks or `us-stock-data` (e.g., `us-stock://1/1`) for U.S. stocks to fetch data, assuming they provide daily high and previous close values. (Note: Exact data fields are unspecified, so verify the output.)

### Task 2: Finding Stocks with Significant Institutional Inflow and Upward Trends

This task involves identifying stocks with large "main force" (主力, likely institutional investors) inflow and an upward price trend, indicating potential for a surge, based on dynamic daily data changes.

#### Steps for a Single Stock

1. **Fetch Historical Daily Data**:
   - Use `get-daily-stock-data` with `outputsize='full'` to get daily data (e.g., close, volume) for the past 100 days.
2. **Detect Institutional Inflow**:
   - Calculate the average volume over the past N days (e.g., N=20).
   - Check if today’s volume is significantly higher (e.g., 2x the average), suggesting institutional buying.
3. **Confirm Upward Trend**:
   - Compute a 20-day moving average (MA) of the closing price.
   - Verify if today’s closing price is above the 20-day MA.
4. **Optional Intraday Analysis**:
   - For dynamic changes within the day, use `get-stock-data` (e.g., `interval='5min'`) to monitor volume spikes and price increases.

#### Example for a U.S. Stock

- **Stock**: `AAPL`
- **Data**: `get-daily-stock-data('AAPL', outputsize='full')`.
- **Average Volume**: Past 20-day avg = 1M shares; today’s volume = 2.5M shares (2.5x > 1M).
- **20-day MA**: 150.00; today’s close = 155.00 (> 150.00).
- **Result**: `AAPL` shows significant inflow and an upward trend.

#### For Multiple Stocks

- Apply the steps to each stock in your list.
- Use `us-stock-data` (e.g., `us-stock://1/1`) or `hs-stock-data` (e.g., `hs-stock://sh601009`) to fetch data for multiple stocks, then filter based on the criteria.

### Task 3: Quantitative Analysis Scripts, Automation, and Markdown Reports

For efficiency or complex analysis, write Python scripts to process data, generate visualizations, and create Markdown reports with embedded images.

#### Steps to Automate

1. **Setup**:
   - Use Python with libraries: `pandas` (data manipulation), `matplotlib`/`mplfinance` (visualizations), and the MCP tools (e.g., `get_daily_stock_data`).
2. **Fetch and Analyze Data**:
   - Loop through a list of stock symbols.
   - Apply Task 1 and/or Task 2 criteria.
3. **Visualize**:
   - For qualifying stocks, plot charts (e.g., candlestick with volume) and save as images.
4. **Generate Report**:
   - Compile results into a Markdown file with text and image references.

#### Example Script

```python
import pandas as pd
import mplfinance as mpf
from mcp_tools import get_daily_stock_data, get_stock_data

# Stock list
symbols = ['sh601009', 'AAPL']
report_content = '# Stock Analysis Report\n\n'

for symbol in symbols:
    # Task 1: Check limit up (assuming Chinese stock context for 10%)
    daily_data = get_daily_stock_data(symbol, outputsize='full')
    if daily_data is None:
        continue
    daily_data = daily_data.sort_values('Date')
    daily_data['prev_close'] = daily_data['Close'].shift(1)
    daily_data['limit_up'] = daily_data['prev_close'] * 1.10
    if daily_data['High'].iloc[-1] >= daily_data['limit_up'].iloc[-1]:
        report_content += f'## {symbol} - Hit Limit Up\n'
        report_content += f'- High: {daily_data["High"].iloc[-1]:.2f}, Limit Up: {daily_data["limit_up"].iloc[-1]:.2f}\n\n'

    # Task 2: Check inflow and trend
    avg_volume = daily_data['Volume'].rolling(window=20).mean().iloc[-1]
    today_volume = daily_data['Volume'].iloc[-1]
    daily_data['MA20'] = daily_data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()
    today_close = daily_data['Close'].iloc[-1]
    ma20 = daily_data['MA20'].iloc[-1]
    if today_volume > 2 * avg_volume and today_close > ma20:
        report_content += f'## {symbol} - Institutional Inflow & Uptrend\n'
        report_content += f'- Volume: {today_volume} (avg: {avg_volume:.2f})\n'
        report_content += f'- Close: {today_close:.2f}, MA20: {ma20:.2f}\n\n'
        # Plot chart
        mpf.plot(daily_data.tail(50), type='candle', volume=True, savefig=f'{symbol}.png')
        report_content += f'![{symbol} Chart]({symbol}.png)\n\n'

# Save report
with open('stock_report.md', 'w') as f:
    f.write(report_content)
```

#### Notes

- **Data Format**: Assumes `get_daily_stock_data` returns a DataFrame with `Date`, `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, `Volume`. Adjust based on actual output.
- **Customization**: Modify thresholds (e.g., 2x volume, 20-day MA) or add indicators (e.g., MACD, RSI).
- **Intraday**: For Task 2’s intraday dynamics, replace `get_daily_stock_data` with `get_stock_data` and analyze 5min intervals.

### Additional Tips

- **Resources**: Use `hs-stock-data` for Chinese stocks (e.g., `hs-stock://sh601009`) or `us-stock-data` for U.S. stocks (e.g., `us-stock://1/1`) to explore bulk data, though you may need to process it manually or script pagination.
- **Alerts**: `get-stock-alerts` can flag stocks with significant price movements (e.g., `threshold=10`), but it’s per-symbol and less specific for limit ups or inflows.
- **Efficiency**: For large stock lists, optimize scripts with parallel processing if the MCP Server supports it.
